# BioJava in Jupyter Notebooks 
[![GitHub License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/sbl-sdsc/biojava-notebooks.svg)](https://github.com/sbl-sdsc/biojava-notebooks/blob/master/LICENSE)

The example notebooks demonstrate how to run BioJava applications in a Jupyter Notebook and JupyterLab. 


The nbviewer links below provide a non-interactive preview of notebooks and ![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg) buttons launch
notebooks in your web browser using the Binder ([mybinder.org](https://mybinder.org/)) server (may be slow!). The HTML links provide a permanent static record of the notebooks. All notebooks can also be launched directly from the links in the 0-Workflow.ipynb top-level notebook.
